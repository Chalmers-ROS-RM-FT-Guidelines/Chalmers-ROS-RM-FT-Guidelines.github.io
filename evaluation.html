            <p>
                This section discusses the outcomes of the validation with
                experts from industry and academia made through questionnaires (available in the replication package section of the
                website). Our goal is to check whether the guidelines
                synthesized from literature and insights extracted from open-
                source ROS repositories are considered to be useful, clear,
                and applicable by developers and QA teams testing and
                verifying ROS code. To this end, we elicit three hypotheses
                per guideline:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>H1. Overall, the guideline is useful. (Usefulness)</li>
                <li>H2. The formulation of the guideline is clear. (Clarity)</li>
                <li>H3. The guideline is applicable to ROS-based systems.
                    (Applicability)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>                
                Differently from usefulness, we note that applicability
                refers to the extent to which the respondents consider that
                the guideline could be directly applied to ROS-based systems
                that they have worked with at the moment of the survey or in
                the past. In turn, usefulness refers to ROS-based systems in
                general.
            </p>

            <p>

                We received 55 answers to the questionnaire, of which 33
            were from developers and 22 from quality assurance (QA)
            teams. To obtain those answers, we sent 1032 emails out of
            which: 306 targeted paper authors, 772 targeted developers
            (extracted from repositories), and 68 targeted experts we met
            personally. We excluded 114 emails due to intersections, e.g.
            paper authors that were also targeted developers. Addition-
            ally, we shared posts in the ROS discourse forum. Duplicated
            emails were removed. The 39-day campaign stopped when
            we did not receive any more answers from the candidate
            respondents. The questionnaires were tailored to check the
            three hypotheses. In addition, we asked each respondent
            to answer four other questions:
            </p>

            
            <ul>
                <li>(i) for how long they have
                    worked in robotics</li>
                <li>(ii) what their experience with ROS was</li>
                <li>(iii) what kinds of organizations they have worked in</li>
                <li>(iv) what robotics domains they have worked on</li>
            </ul>



            <h2>  Likert plot for the questionnaire answers </h2>
            <img  class="center" src="./img/linkert2.png">
            <p class="center" style="text-align: center;"> Figure 1: Likert plot for the questionnaire answers </p>


            <p>
                The Likert plot above provides an overview of the answers
                from the questionnaire. While the majority of votes lean to the
                ‘Agree’ side, some guideline descriptions (i.e., CD2, CI1, CI2,
                CI3, I1, I2, I3, I4, MTA1, MTA2, PE2, SDB1, SDB2, SDB3, SE2)
                received ‘Strongly Disagree’ votes. This subsection mostly
                analyses disagreements in contrast to agreements since they
                might shed light on new research opportunities. To clarify
                the disagreements, we collected comments left in free text
                from the online questionnaire14. The questionnaire targeted
                per group comments, in which respondents could direct their
                suggestion either to the whole group or to specific guidelines,
                usually indicating their identifier.
            </p>

            <img class="center" src="./img/boxplots.png">
            <p class="center" style="text-align: center;"> Figure 2: Boxplots for the results bird’s eye view </p>

            <p>
                In complement to the Likert plot analysis, we back up the
                responses using statistical analysis. First, we assume that the
                answers from the Likert items are symmetric and this allows
                us to use boxplots and visualize whether the hypotheses
                (H1 − H3) hold for each guideline from a bird’s eye view.
                We map the Likert items to integer values according to
                the following rule: Strongly Disagree=1, Disagree=2, Agree=3,
                Strongly Agree=4.
            </p>

            <p>
                At first glance to the boxplot above, we observe that
                the medians revolve around Agree and Strongly Agree for the 
                three dimensions (i.e., applicability, clarity, and usefulness).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Therefore, overall developers and QA teams agree that
                the synthesized guidelines are applicable, useful, and clear.
                However, the boxplots’ smallest value for a set of guidelines
                (i.e., SDB1, SDB3, PE2, I1, I3, MTA2, CI2) reveals there were
                respondents that Strongly Disagree with their applicability.
                In light of such results, we further analysed the statistical
                and practical significance regarding the agreement for these
                guidelines (see Sect. 5.3.1 of the report). For those guidelines where
                the significance test failed or practical significance had a
                small effect, we conducted a follow-up discussion with
                the questionnaire respondents to understand the causes for
                disagreement (see Sect. 5.4 of the report).

            </p>

            <h2> Statistical Significance </h2>
            <img class="center" src="./img/statistical_sig.png">
            <p class="center" style="text-align: center;"> Figure 3: Wilcoxon one-sample test for statistical significance
                (hypothesis: μ ≥ 0) </p>

            <p>
                We test our hypotheses for sta-
                tistical significance by employing the one-sample Wilcoxon
                test. The test checks whether the sum of all the respondents
                for each guideline, e.g. AR1, and each dimension, e.g., applicability, is greater than 0 with a 5% significance level. The
                resulting plot above summarises all the tests, combinations
                of guidelines, and dimensions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Importantly, the plot highlights that guidelines CI2, MTA2,
                and PE2 resulted in p-values larger than 0.05, specifically for applicability. Precisely, CI2p−value = 0.1948536,
                MTA2p−value = 0.3416874, and PE2p−value = 0.1037148.
                The result suggests that the data collected does not confirm
                that the aforementioned guidelines are applicable to ROS-
                based systems, as pointed out by the medians from Fig. 2. In
                complement, the tests confirm that the remaining correlation
                between guideline (below the red dashed line in Fig. 3) and
                attributes applicability, clarity, and usefulness is statistically
                significant.
            </p>

            <h2> Practical significance </h2>
            <img class="center" src="./img/practical_sig.png">
            <p class="center" style="text-align: center;"> Figure 4:  Effect size for one sample Wilcoxon test for practical
                significance
                </p>

            <p>
                We test our hypotheses for practical significance by calculating the effect size given by the one-
                sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Similarly to the statistical
                significance test, the test checks whether the effect size for
                one sample Wilcoxon test is greater than zero for the sum of
                all respondent’s answers to the combinations of guidelines
                and dimensions. The resulting plot, illustrated above, summarises the
                effect size for all combinations of guidelines and dimensions.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to the definitions from Cohen J. limiting
                values for effect size are small effect < 0.3, moderate effect
                > 0.3 and < 0.5, and large effect > 0.5. When it comes
                to applicability, guidelines CI2, MTA2, and PE2 fall in the
                small effect category, confirming that we need further data
                to strengthen our conclusions. Guidelines AR2, CI2, I1, I3,
                SDB1, and SDB3 are ranked with moderate size effect, which
                is enough in our case to justify their practical significance.
                Finally, the large-size effect guidelines are the rest, which
                confirms their practical significance.
