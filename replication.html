                The methodology for the paper is split into 3 consecutive cycles.

                according to design science </p>



            <h1> First Cycle </h1>

            <p>

                The first cycle is devoted to establishing
                awareness of the state-of-the-art of field-based testing and
                runtime verification in robotics through existing surveys.
                We, then, reviewed the surveys to define the terminology
                to delimit the scope of the study and the search strings that
                we would use in the next iteration. We then validated the
                terminology and the search strings internally, through peer
                reviews and discussions with co-authors to consolidate the
                terminology and scope. 

            </p>

            <p>The surveys used withing this cycle are:</p>

            <p> The literature review was built around a study protocol, to provide a systematic method for reviewing papers within the topic.
                We use automatic search-engines for collecting an initial set of papers, i.e., IEEEXplore, ACM Digital
                Library, and Scopus.</p>

                <p class="center" style="text-align: center;"> Table 1: Inclusion Criterion (IC) and Exclusion Criterion (EC) </p>

                <p>Screening papers consists of passing the complete set of potentially useful papers through a filter. The
                    outcome is the set of relevant papers. Thus, in this section we define the filter, by means of inclusion
                    and exclusion criteria, and then the procedure to be followed when discarding papers.
                    The individual work of screening consists of checking if the paper is in compliance with the criteria
                    presented in Table 1. This is done by parsing the paper in search for ROS or ”robotic operating system”,
                    which is usually spotted in the abstract and introduction. Then, looking for verification, validation, and
                    testing techniques names (e.g., runtime monitoring, testing, theorem proving, model checking). Once a
                    technique is found, the surrounding text is read to confirm if there is an explicit description of how it is
                    used–or reference. Finally, scanning whether the used technique uses the ROS ecosystem.</p>


            <h1> Second Cycle </h1>

            <p>
                For the Second Cycle, we then used the search strings defined in
                the previous cycle to perform a systematic literature review.
                Then, we defined a template for describing the guidelines
                and a first draft of the guidelines. As a preliminary validation
                step, we presented a subset of the guidelines’ sketches at
                the Robotics Software Engineering workshop. We received
                feedback on the guidelines from three experts in robotics
                through a questionnaire and subsequent discussion.

            <h1> Third Cycle </h1>

            <p>
                The third cycle was devoted to consolidating
                the set of guidelines and validating them with experts from
                industry and academia. The comments from the expert
                evaluation in cycle 2 suggested a need to complement the
                guidelines with concrete examples, e.g. “Can you provide code
                examples?” or “Without examples I wonder how such a specification pattern could look like.”. 
                Thus, guided by such comments,
                we decided to perform a specific search and to mine online
                repositories.
            </p>

                The scripts adapted from Ivano Malavolta et. al from the project 'Mining guidelines for architecting robotics software'. 

                They can be found in the project's <a title="Replication package"

            <p>
                We searched for repositories mentioned in the documents in complement
                to repositories that touched upon the theme of each guideline
                sketch. In the solution phase, we then developed the final
                version of the guidelines, provided exemplars for each of
                them, and clustered the guidelines as they are presented
                in this paper. Finally, we validated the final set of guidelines with practitioners and researchers. We designed and
                distributed an online questionnaire to experts from industry
                and academia, through the ROS community forum (namely
                ROS Discourse), LinkedIn, X (Twitter), and to experts we
                met at robotics and software engineering conferences. Before
                releasing the questionnaire to the wider community, we
                performed a pre-study with an experienced roboticist and
                active member of the ROS community and two members
                with widely recognized contributions to robotic software
                engineering from academia. The results from the third cycle
                confirmed the relevance of the guidelines and helped us to
                fine-tune them.

            <h3> Questionnaire </h3>

            <p>
                This is the the validation questionnaire used to gather insights from
                experts from industry and academia.

                The main objective of the questionnaire was to check 
                whether the guidelines synthesized from literature and insights extracted from open-source 
                ROS repositories are considered to be useful, clear,
                and applicable by developers and QA teams testing and
                verifying ROS code.

                The mailer script used to distribute the questionnaire is also published on <a title="Replication package"
