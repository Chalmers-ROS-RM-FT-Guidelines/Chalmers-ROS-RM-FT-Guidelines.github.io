Security and privacy is worded confusingly. Specifically, it does not define ""participants"", which is not a term I've ever encountered in robotics developments (outside of scientific experimentation). I work in product development, and the end users are customers, operators, or bystanders.

Timing constraints are important and often-overlooked early in the development cycle. I think the wording here may focus too much on real-time requirements, when many ROS-based systems are not running on top of hardware/software with real-time capabilities.",Fully agree,Fully agree,Agree,Fully agree,Agree,Agree,"CD1 feels too strongly worded. It is a good ideal goal, however I've found that the development process, particularly with complex systems and changing requirements over time will often result in single nodes that grow in complexity. When you go back and evaluate those nodes to see how they might be broken up, sometimes there are clear divisions of responsibility, and other times there are not. In terms of continuing development progress, it can often be more efficient to keep a singlular node that implements a more complex behavior than to attempt to break it up into smaller components. I would modify the message here to include clearly identifying the role of each node in the system and mapping out the relationship between nodes involved in the particular desired behaviors. This can help the developer ensure they limit the scope of work performed by a single node in a meaningful way, rather than arbitrarily breaking it down.

CD2 is a a case where it feels like real-world anomalies will nearly always get in the way. I have experienced a case where a local service call on the same computer failed, one time in a million. System time jumps can also occur. While typically small, occasionally you will see a large time jump if NTP does something unexpected. With enough robots and enough usage, these (and surely other) odd events will occur. Having consistent and deterministic behavior is good, but I would also emphasize developing robustness to anomolous events as much as possible.",Disagree,Agree,Fully disagree,Fully agree,Agree,Fully agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,"I2: I would also recommend CSV-based logging. Usage of tools like PlotJuggler (works very nicely with bags and CSVs) can be life-changing. There's no mention of data analysis techniques. Collecting data without an analysis approach in mind will often result in collecting insufficient or incorrect data. I would encourage data logging to be integrated as early as possible within the development cycle of a new subsystem or behavior. One thing that is not mentioned is techniques for collecting data from remote systems. There's an implicit assumption that all data is immediately available. However, with rosbags and any high-resolution sensor data (lidar, point clouds, images, etc), the file size will grow very large very fast. It is often necessary to isolate the critical time periods of data, to perform detailed analysis on only a subset of time.

I3: In my experience, it is very difficult to predict many of the faults that a robotic system will experience without substantial time investment, both career-wise and with the specific system that is being developed. While I agree with the intention of this guideline, my general feeling is that it will result in a lot of development to implement fake faults, and you're still going to miss so many real faults, that you would often be better served by simply spending more time actually running and testing the system in a wider variety of environments. In some ways, it's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: you need to test to figure out what can go wrong before you can build ways to simulate all the different ways things can go wrong. Building tools to simulate faults can also be very difficult and time-consuming.",> 10 years,"I have contributed to ROS package(s) (e.g., development, testing)",Academia;Industry;Government,Marine robotics;General-purpose;Outdoor UAVs and ground vehicles,anonymous,"Yes, via my email address above"
